## Natural merge sort

The code of this problem is located [Here.](https://github.com/Snaseri2001/Data-Structure-Course/blob/main/NaturalMergeSort_Cpp/NaturalMergeSort/src/NaturalMergeSort.h)

In this exercise we have to complete a part of the "Sort" , "FindBorder" and "Merge" function , which is located in "NaturalMergeSort.h" :

<br> 
This function gets an array as an input and sort it increasingly with the method of "Natural Merge Sort" with "FindBorder" and "Merge" functions. The parameters of the functions are defined as :
<br>
arr : array of inputs
<br>
n : nimber of data<br>

<br>
This function receives an array as input and the index of the points in which the order P. Oudi
Returns unobserved in a queue as output D. Parameterized this T Refer to this section
Is:
<br>
arr : array of inputs
<br>
n : nimber of data<br>
Points : â€‹A series of dotted indexes of arrays in which the order of p Recurrence has not been observed.
<br>
In this function, the integration operation is performed. To perform this operation from the array temp as an array
The parameters of this function are as follows:

<br>
arr : an array that we want to perform the merge operation 
<br>
the elements of [p , q-1] are ordered and also [q , r-1] is ordered.
<br>
An explanation about the Queue :
<br>
A simple data structure is a data structure in which elements are added to the end of a list
The deletion is done from the beginning of the list.In the real world
The first person to enter the queue is the first person to leave the queue He goes out.
In this exercise we tend to familiar with the implementaion of this data structure.
<br>
Push : Using this function, a new element can be added to the end of the queue.
<br>
Pop:Using this function, the element at the head of the queue can be removed from the queue.
<br>
Front:Using this function, you can access the element at the head of the queue.
<br>
Size:Using this function, the current size of the queue can be accessed.
<br>
An example of a program in which the queue data structure is used:
